# QR Code Reader

This code is a QR code reader implemented in Java using the ZXing library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for scanning and decoding QR codes.

## How it works

The code snippet provided is part of a larger Java class that handles the QR code scanning functionality. Here's a breakdown of the important parts:

1. The code starts by declaring a `Result` object and a `BufferedImage` object, both initially set to `null`.

2. It checks if the QR code scanner, represented by the `wc` object, is open. If it is, it proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

3. Inside the loop, it retrieves an image from the QR code scanner using the `getImage()` method. If the image is `null`, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

4. It creates a `LuminanceSource` object from the retrieved image using the `BufferedImageLuminanceSource` class.

5. It creates a `BinaryBitmap` object from the `LuminanceSource` object using the `HybridBinarizer` class.

6. It attempts to decode the QR code using the `MultiFormatReader` class. If a QR code is successfully decoded, the result is stored in the `result` object.

7. If the `result` object is not `null`, it sets the text of a text field (`resultfield`) in the GUI to the decoded QR code text.

8. The loop continues indefinitely, scanning for QR codes until the program is terminated.

## Usage

To use this QR code reader, you need to have the ZXing library added to your Java project. You can find the library and its documentation at [ZXing GitHub repository](https://github.com/zxing/zxing).

Once you have the library set up, you can instantiate an object of the `ReadQR` class and call its `run()` method to start scanning for QR codes. The decoded QR code text will be displayed in the GUI.
